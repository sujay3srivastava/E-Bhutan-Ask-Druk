# Ask Druk🐉-  Bhutan's Sovereign AI Citizen Assistant

**Empowering every Bhutanese citizen with instant access to government services and legal rights**
My hackathon project for E-Bhutan Hackathon by Draper Startup House. Ask Druk is a sovereign Al-powered citizen assistant that makes government services, legal rights, and regulatory information accessible to every Bhutanese citizen in simple, conversational language.

## 🌟 The Problem

Every day, thousands of Bhutanese citizens:
- **Waste hours** in government offices due to confusion about procedures
- **Make multiple trips** because of missing documents
- **Miss opportunities** due to lack of information about their rights
- **Feel intimidated** by complex legal language

The information exists, but it's scattered across dozens of websites in legal jargon that ordinary citizens can't understand.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Ask Druk** is Bhutan's first AI-powered citizen assistant that:
- ✅ Answers any question about government services in **plain language**
- ✅ Provides **step-by-step guides** for all procedures
- ✅ Explains **citizen rights** in simple terms
- ✅ Finds the **right office** and contact person
- ✅ Works in **English and Dzongkha** (རྫོང་ཁ)
- ✅ Available **24/7** on web, mobile, and SMS
