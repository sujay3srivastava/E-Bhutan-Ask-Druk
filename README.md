## 🌟 The Problem

Every day, thousands of Bhutanese citizens face these challenges:
- **Waste hours** waiting in government offices due to confusion about procedures
- **Make multiple trips** because of missing documents or unclear requirements
- **Miss opportunities** due to lack of accessible information about their rights
- **Feel overwhelmed** by complex legal language and bureaucratic processes
- **Limited access** to government services outside office hours (9 AM - 5 PM)

The information exists across government websites, but it's scattered, often in technical language, and difficult for ordinary citizens to understand and navigate.
