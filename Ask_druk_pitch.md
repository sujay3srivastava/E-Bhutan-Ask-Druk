## 🎯 **The Problem That Keeps Citizens Awake**

**Every day in Bhutan:**
- **Thousands of citizens** waste hours in government offices due to confusion about procedures
- **Multiple trips** are made because of missing documents or unclear requirements  
- **Opportunities are missed** due to lack of accessible information about their rights
- **Complex legal language** overwhelms ordinary citizens trying to understand their rights
- **Government services** are only available 9 AM - 5 PM, leaving citizens stranded after hours

**The Result:** Citizens feel disconnected from their government and frustrated by bureaucratic barriers.
